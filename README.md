1. Implement Depth-First Search (DFS)
2. Run GreedySearch() with Kitchener as root node (initi_state) and Listowel as goal_name.
3.  Record and compare the paths that three different search agorithms take to reach the goal.
The path is the sequence of nodes (cities) visited to get to the goal. Compare BFS(), UCS()
and GreedySearch(). Recording the path should only require the addition of a few lines of
code to the above functions.
